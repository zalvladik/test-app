1) Hi, I didn't know the maximum number of events that could fit on a single line, 
so I set it to four. Most likely, it should have been two lines, 
as shown in the task screenshot, but I wanted to make it more challenging. 
Sometimes the results are not optimal for 4 elements, though generally it works well. 
Placement for 2-3 elements is good.

2) Occasionally, I used the term "legacy code" xd. 
Please don't judge too harshly. I tried to minimize downloading external libraries 
and wasn't sure if they were allowed. For example, I avoided using "axios"

3) Anyway, it seems like I've met all the requirements. Have a great day! :)
